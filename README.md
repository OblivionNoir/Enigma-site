# Enigma-site
The purpose of this site is to be a cool place to share strange mysteries and phenomena, with a sort of twitter/reddit style scroll layout. It is heavily inspired by my love of strange Internet phenomena, especially youtube channels like Nexpo and Reignbot, and creepy/mysterious stuff in general.
